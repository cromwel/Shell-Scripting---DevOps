# Shell-Scripting---DevOps
simple devops illustration of shell scripting using GO

Shell Scripting: series or sequence of UNIX commands written in a plain text file. Instead of specifying one job/command at a time, in shell scripting we give a list of UNIX commands like a to-do list in a file to execute.

This programs allows you to read and modify an xml file and write into a new file.

## RUN PROGRAM
Run the following commands:-

```bash
#touch translator.go
#go build
#./main
```
